      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>Its members perform with prestigious organizations including the New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Pittsburgh Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra and the London Symphony.  Founded in 2002 by clarinetist and Artistic Director Terrance Patterson,  

      <!-- <br><br>Called “a remarkable ensemble,” the group’s flexible structure allows for astonishing combinations of virtuoso players and rising stars, creating “riveting” performances of the standard classical music repertoire. The Ritz Chamber Players is also unique in its dedication to showcase the works of African-American composers with exceedingly artistic and informed interpretations. Its highly successful début concert at New York’s Weill Recital Hall in Carnegie Hall was marked by a standing room only crowd, with critics proclaiming the group’s performance “extraordinary” and “vital and fresh.”  The group made its international radio début on the BBC World Service and WYNC New York with a concert broadcast to more than 40 countries, and its first national television appearance on the 37th Annual NAACP Image Awards. The Ritz Chamber Players has been guests of the highly-praised National Public Radio and the Tavis Smiley Shows and is a regular performer at the Madison and Amelia Island Chamber Music Festivals. -->

      <p>The Ritz Chamber Players present programs that are thought provoking, inspiring and relevant, showing the power of classical music to express the complexity of our time. Chamber music in particular often reveals a shared perspective because of its inherent intimacy. We hope you enjoy these performances. </p>

        <h1>In Remembrance of The Dream</h1>
        <p>Ties That Bind: From Swastika to Jim Crow
            The Ritz Chamber Players are excited to present a concert performance of works that express the “Ties That Bind” the African-American and Jewish communities in the United States. To an extent, African-American and Jewish people came into contact through the Atlantic Slave Trade during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the crux of their relationship has been largely ideological, as the two groups bonded as fellow minorities.  For their part, African-Americans sympathized and related to the history of the Jewish people facing oppression in both Egypt and Europe. African-American spirituals and slave songs such as “Go Down, Moses” reflect these ties, as you will hear within the stunning work by award-winning living Black composer Adulphus HAILSTORK in his American Landscape No. 2 for Violin and Cello. </p>

        <h1>Tragedy Toward Peace</h1>
        <p>For our Black History Month Performance the Ritz Chamber Players share this thought provoking program that commemorates the violet gun deaths of so many of our African-American youth. Gun violence in our communities, police brutality and racial profiling—these are not just “black issues” or “African-American issues,” they are American issues. This tribute concert is marked by a performance of the remarkable work String Quartet No.1 based on the spiritual “Calvary” by celebrated African-American composer Coleridge-Taylor PERKINSON written when he was 17 years old! As we take the time to remember the tragic death of each of these young men, we leave you with a work of peace and hope! Lee JOHNSON’s “Infinitude” has the spoken/narrated text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that begins with: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.

        <h1>Spring Spectacular</h1>
        <p>The Ritz Chamber Players will bring a close to its 2014-2015 concert season by featuring the world première of the celebrated living Black composer James Lee String’s Quartet No. 2 and the DVOŘÁK Piano Quintet No. 2 in A major, Op. 81 work of an outstanding composer’s music, which is based on beautiful tonal themes.  A fanciful voyage through song, this is our departing musical gift of extraordinary musical fusions that are sure to take listeners on a breathtaking Sonic Journey! The quintet is a mixture of Dvorak’s personal form of expressive lyricism as well as a utilization of elements from Czech folk music. Shortly after his arrival in America in 1892, Dvorak wrote a series of newspaper articles reflecting on the state of American music. He supported the concept that African-American music should be used as a foundation for the growth of American music. He felt that through the music of African-Americans, Americans would find their own national style of music.
